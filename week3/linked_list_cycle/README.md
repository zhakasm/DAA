# Linked List Cycle

## 1. Problem
Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list contains a cycle. A cycle exists if a node can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

## 2. Approach
I implemented Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Two Pointers / "Tortoise and Hare"):
1. Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, at the head of the list.
2. Traverse the list moving slow by 1 step and fast by 2 steps in each iteration.
3. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer inside the loop.
4. If fast reaches null (end of list), there is no cycle.

### Step-by-Step Tracing Example
Input: 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 (where -4 points back to `2`)

- Initial State: slow at 3, fast at 3.
- Iteration 1:
  - slow moves to 2.
  - fast moves to 0.
- Iteration 2:
  - slow moves to 0.
  - fast moves to 2 (following -4 -> `2`).
- Iteration 3:
  - slow moves to -4.
  - fast moves to -4 (following 0 -> `-4`).
- Condition Match: slow == fast (both point to `-4`).
- Return: true.

## 3. Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$
  - Reason: If there is no cycle, fast reaches the end in $N / 2$ steps. If there is a cycle, fast catches up to slow within a distance bounded by the cycle length ($K \le N$). In both cases, time complexity is linear, $O(N)$.

* Space Complexity: $O(1)$
  - Reason: We only use two pointer variables (`slow` and `fast`), regardless of the size of the linked list.

## 4. Reflection / Improvement
- Alternative Approach: Another common solution uses a Hash Set to store visited nodes.
  - Drawback of Hash Set: It requires $O(N)$ auxiliary space.
- Conclusion: The Two-Pointer (Floyd's) approach is optimal in terms of both time ($O(N)$) and space ($O(1)$).
