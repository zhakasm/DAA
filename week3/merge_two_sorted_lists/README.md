# Merge Two Sorted Lists

## 1. Problem
Given the heads of two sorted linked lists, list1 and list2. Merge the two lists into one sorted linked list by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists, and return the head of the merged list.

## 2. Approach
I used an iterative approach with a dummy node:
1. Create a dummy node to serve as the start of the merged list, and a pointer current initialized to dummy.
2. Compare the current elements of list1 and list2.
3. Attach the smaller node to current.next and move the pointer of that list forward.
4. Move current forward.
5. Repeat until one of the lists becomes empty.
6. Attach the remaining nodes from the non-empty list to current.next.

### Step-by-Step Tracing Example
Input: list1 = [1, 2, 4], list2 = [1, 3, 4]

- Initial State: dummy -> -1, current -> dummy
- Iteration 1: Compare 1 (list1) and 1 (list2). 1 <= 1 is True.
  - current.next = 1 (from list1)
  - Move list1 to node 2.
- Iteration 2: Compare 2 (list1) and 1 (list2). 2 <= 1 is False.
  - current.next = 1 (from list2)
  - Move list2 to node 3.
- Iteration 3: Compare 2 (list1) and 3 (list2). 2 <= 3 is True.
  - current.next = 2 (from list1)
  - Move list1 to node 4.
- Iteration 4: Compare 4 (list1) and 3 (list2). 4 <= 3 is False.
  - current.next = 3 (from list2)
  - Move list2 to node 4.
- Iteration 5: Compare 4 (list1) and 4 (list2). 4 <= 4 is True.
  - current.next = 4 (from list1)
  - Move list1 to null.
- After Loop: list1 is empty. Attach remaining list2 (`[4]`).
- Result: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4].

## 3. Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: $O(N + M)$
  - Reason: In each step of the while loop, we process exactly one node from either list1 or list2. Therefore, the maximum number of iterations is proportional to the total number of nodes in both lists ($N + M$).

* Space Complexity: $O(1)$
  - Reason: No additional data structures are created. We only adjust pointers between existing nodes and create one dummy variable.

## 4. Reflection / Improvement
- Is there a more efficient approach? The $O(N + M)$ time complexity is optimal because every node must be visited at least once to determine order.
- Alternative Approach: A recursive approach can be used, but it would require $O(N + M)$ auxiliary space due to call stack. Thus, the iterative approach is optimal in space efficiency.
